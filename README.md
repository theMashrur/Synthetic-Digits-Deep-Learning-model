# Synthetic-Digits-Deep-Learning-model

This is a repository of python notebooks which each define and train
somewhat different neural networks, using the Keras API, designed for an Image multi-class classification problem.
This was created for a 1st year undergraduate research project.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

```
pip install tensorflow matplotlip numpy
```

Having a CUDA enabled GPU, with all the necessary CUDA and cudnn files installed
is recommended
